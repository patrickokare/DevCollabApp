  <p class="chat-message"> Hello!!!! </p>
            <p class="chat-message"> This is an online brainstorming tool I made that generates random words.

                This word randomizer should help spark your creative imagination if you're looking to think up a domain name, a band name, a project name or whatever.

                Right now it generates 6 random words by default but you can change that to generate anywhere from two to ten words.

                For band names and projects, I find that setting the random word chooser to three or four words gives you optimal results to work with.

                If you're looking to start a website, I've also created a page with tools that helps you create blog names.

                Once you click the generate button, the random words will appear just below the button. Have fun brainstorming. Be inspired</p>

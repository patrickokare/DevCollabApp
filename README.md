DevCollab - Wale Patrick(2016) 

Development Collaboration, shorten as DevCollab, was a web application I designed to better facilitate collaboration between computer students at my University during group work. 
I accomplished this by harnessing a versatile text-editor for remote coding, real-time messaging, file transfer between users,
real-time video conferencing and integrating them together to work concurrently into one system.

I made use of Azure’s cloud computing platform to host both the application’s web server and MySQL database to store and access user data. 
They provided the infrastructure for utilizing cloud computing features in the backend development and management of DevCollab.
I used the Adminer database visualization tool to manage the relational tables and user information. The frontend interface was designed
using HTML5 and other web development technologies such as Jquery, Ajax, PHP, and Bootstrap framework for mobile responsiveness.

Components
The major functional component of DevCollab was the code editor, which allowed collaborators to work through their software codes and
save these codes into their work file. This consisted of an existing Library from Code Mirror using JavaScript to set the modes, theme,
and other properties from the Library. Users could also share access to their code editor with other collaborators for group work and 
assistance. A real-time messaging chat was also integrated into DevCollab which allowed two or more students to communicate with 
each other through text messages. In addition, a file sharing component was also integrated into DevCollab to allow document
sharing among collaborators.

Finally, a video conferencing component which students could use to interact with their peers in real time. 
WebRTC framework via JavaScript APIs was used to display real-time videos on the application.

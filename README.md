**DevCollab - Wale Patrick (2016)**

**Overview:**  
DevCollab is a web application I developed to enhance collaboration among computer science students during group projects. It integrates multiple tools into a single platform, enabling remote coding, real-time messaging, file sharing, and video conferencing, all within a unified system.

**Hosting and Infrastructure:**  
I hosted DevCollab on Azure, leveraging its cloud computing platform for both the web server and MySQL database. Azure's infrastructure facilitated seamless backend development and management. For database visualization, I utilized Adminer to efficiently manage relational tables and user data.

**Technology Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** Designed with HTML5, jQuery, Ajax, PHP, and Bootstrap for responsive design.
- **Backend:** MySQL database hosted on Azure.
- **Code Editor:** Integrated with CodeMirror, a versatile JavaScript-based text editor, enabling real-time collaborative coding with customizable themes and modes.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Allows users to communicate instantly through text.
- **File Sharing:** Facilitates easy document sharing among collaborators.
- **Video Conferencing:** Powered by WebRTC via JavaScript APIs for real-time video interaction.

**Key Features:**  
- **Collaborative Code Editing:** Users can work together on code in real time, with the ability to share access and collaborate on the same project.
- **Instant Messaging:** Integrated chat functionality allows students to communicate effectively during projects.
- **File Transfer:** Secure file sharing between users to streamline the collaboration process.
- **Video Conferencing:** Real-time video calls to enhance communication and coordination within the team.
